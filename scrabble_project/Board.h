	   MoveException:
		- "OUTOFBOUNDS": One or more tile would have to be placed out of bounds of the board.
		- "OCCUPIED": The proposed starting square was occupied by a tile already.
		- "NOSTART": During the very first move, the player did not use the start square.
		- "NOWORDS": The player did not produce any possible words (placed one letter as the first move, or no letters on a subsequent move).
		- "NONEIGHBOR": The proposed move is not adjacent to any previously placed tile.
