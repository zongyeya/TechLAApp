/* The Move class family encodes a move made by one player, including its type
   (PASS, EXCHANGE, PLACE), the tiles used (and use for blanks),
   start square, and direction (if needed).
   Call Move::parseMove() to turn an entered string into its subclass of
   Move, then call apply() on that returned move to have it execute.*/
